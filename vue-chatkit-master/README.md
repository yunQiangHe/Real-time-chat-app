# Build a Real-Time Chat App with Pusher and Vue.js

In this tutorial, we are going to build a real-time chat application using Vue.js powered by [ChatKit](https://pusher.com/chatkit), a service provided by [Pusher](https://pusher.com). The ChatKit service will provide us with a complete backend necessary for building a chat application on any device, leaving us to focus on building a frontend user interface that connects to the ChatKit service via [ChatKit client package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pusher/chatkit-client).

4. Run `npm run serve`
4. Visit http://localhost:8080/ and log in with a valid user
